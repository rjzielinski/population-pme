  abstract = {BACKGROUND In recent years, much of the focus in monitoring child mortality has been on assessing changes in the under-5 mortality rate (U5MR). However, as the U5MR decreases, the share of neonatal deaths (within the first month) tends to increase, warranting increased efforts in monitoring the neonatal mortality rate (NMR) in addition to the U5MR. OBJECTIVE Data on neonatal deaths comes from a range of sources across different countries, with the amount of data available and the quality of data varying widely. Our objective in estimating the NMR globally is to combine all data sources available to obtain accurate estimates, be able to project mortality levels, and have some indication of the uncertainty in the estimates and projections. METHODS We present a new model for estimating the NMR for countries worldwide, using a Bayesian hierarchical model framework. CONTRIBUTION Our modeling approach offers an intuitive way to share information across different countries and time points, and incorporates different sources of error into the estimates. It also improves on previous modeling approaches by allowing for trends observed in NMR to be more driven by the data available, rather than trends in covariates.},

We consider the problem of constructing a representation for data lying on a low-dimensional manifold embedded in a high-dimensional space. Drawing on the correspondence between the graph Laplacian, the Laplace Beltrami operator on the manifold, and the connections to the heat equation, we propose a geometrically motivated algorithm for representing the high-dimensional data. The algorithm provides a computationally efficient approach to nonlinear dimensionality reduction that has locality-preserving properties and a natural connection to clustering. Some potential applications and illustrative examples are discussed.},

The models are also useful for imputation of missing data and exploratory analysis of variance. We prove that the best linear unbiased predictors (BLUPs) from the extended mixed-effects model correspond to solutions of a generalized penalized regression where smoothing parameters are directly related to variance components, and we show that these solutions are natural cubic splines. The model parameters are estimated using a highly efficient implementation of the EM algorithm for restricted maximum likelihood (REML) estimation based on a preliminary eigenvector decomposition. Variability of computed estimates can be assessed with asymptotic techniques or with a novel hierarchical bootstrap resampling scheme for nested mixed-effects models. Our methods are applied to menstrual cycle data from studies of reproductive function that measure daily urinary progesterone; the sample of progesterone curves is stratified by cycles nested within subjects nested within conceptive and nonconceptive groups.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new type of splines—polynomial splines over hierarchical T-meshes (called PHT-splines) to model geometric objects. PHT-splines are a generalization of B-splines over hierarchical T-meshes. We present the detailed construction process of spline basis functions over T-meshes which have the same important properties as B-splines do, such as nonnegativity, local support and partition of unity. As two fundamental operations, cross insertion and cross removal of PHT-splines are discussed. With the new splines, surface models can be constructed efficiently and adaptively to fit open or closed mesh models, where only linear systems of equations with a few unknowns are involved. With this approach, a NURBS surface can be efficiently simplified into a PHT-spline which dramatically reduces the superfluous control points of the NURBS surface. Furthermore, PHT-splines allow for several important types of geometry processing in a natural and efficient manner, such as conversion of a PHT-spline into an assembly of tensor-product spline patches, and shape simplification of PHT-splines over a coarser T-mesh. PHT-splines not only inherit many good properties of Sederberg’s T-splines such as adaptivity and locality, but also extend T-splines in several aspects except that they are only C1 continuous. For example, PHT-splines are polynomial instead of rational; cross insertion/removal of PHT-splines is local and simple.},

For this purpose, imaging and in particular magnetic resonance imaging are of great value in the clinic, but the richness of the images is currently under exploited. In this paper, we propose to characterize myocardial ischemia and reperfusion patterns across a population beyond the scalar measurements used in the clinic. Specifically, we adapted representation learning techniques to not only characterize the population distribution in terms of scar and microvascular obstruction patterns, but also regarding the appearance of late gadolinium images which reflects tissue heterogeneity. To do so, we implemented a hierarchical manifold learning approach where the embedding from a higher-level content (the images) is guided by one from a lower-level content (the infarct and microvascular obstruction segmentations). We demonstrate its relevance on 1711 late gadolinium enhancement slices from 123 patients with acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. We designed ways to balance the contribution of each level in the hierarchy, and quantify its impact on the overall distribution and on sample neighborhoods. We notably observe that the obtained latent space is a balanced contribution between the two levels of the hierarchy, and is more robust to challenging images subjected to artifacts or specific lesion patterns.},

In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical manifold learning framework for time-synchronized fMRI data for elucidating brain dynamics. Our framework—labelled 2-step diffusion maps (2sDM)—is based on diffusion maps, a nonlinear dimensionality reduction method. First, 2sDM learns the manifold of fMRI data for each individual separately and then learns a low-dimensional group-level embedding by integrating individual information. We also propose a method for out-of-sample extension within our hierarchical framework. Using 2sDM, we constructed a single manifold structure based on 6 different task-based fMRI (tfMRI) runs. Results on the tfMRI data show a clear manifold structure with four distinct clusters, or brain states. We extended this to embedding resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) data by first synchronizing across individuals using an optimal orthogonal transformation. The rsfMRI data from the same individuals cleanly embedded onto the four clusters, suggesting that rsfMRI is a collection of different brains states. Overall, our results highlight 2sDM as a powerful method to understand brain dynamics and show that tfMRI and rsfMRI data share representative brain states.},

Our hypothesis is that the space spanned by a set of brain images can be captured, to a close approximation, by a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold. This paper presents a method to learn such a low-dimensional manifold from a given data set. The manifold model is generative—brain images can be constructed from a relatively small set of parameters, and new brain images can be projected onto the manifold. This allows to quantify the geometric accuracy of the manifold approximation in terms of projection distance. The manifold coordinates induce a Euclidean coordinate system on the population data that can be used to perform statistical analysis of the population. We evaluate the proposed method on the OASIS and ADNI brain databases of head MR images in two ways. First, the geometric fit of the method is qualitatively and quantitatively evaluated. Second, the ability of the brain manifold model to explain clinical measures is analyzed by linear regression in the manifold coordinate space. The regression models show that the manifold model is a statistically significant descriptor of clinical parameters.},

  abstract = {The exploration of high-dimensional medical imaging datasets often requires the use of dimensionality reduction techniques. Generally, individual instances in longitudinal studies are not independent as several measurements of the same subjects, acquired at several time points, are included. Most non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques, that rely on defining a neighborhood graph to uncover local geometry, neglect potentially valuable grouping information and thus can lead to a poor estimation of the underlying manifold. Incorporating a-priori grouping knowledge of the data can lead to an improved low-dimensional representation. In this work, an approach to leverage such a-priori information is proposed, with the main interest in generating longitudinal biomarkers to assess a subject's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD), and hence estimate time-to-conversion (TTC) and the mini mental state examination (MMSE) of subjects that develop AD. This is achieved via a novel formulation of the Laplacian Eigenmaps and Isomap manifold learning algorithms, that allows the incorporation of group-constraints. The potential of the proposed formulation was demonstrated on a swiss-roll toy example that clearly illustrates the problems faced by traditional techniques when additional structure is observed in the data. A real data experiment showed that the proposed constrained methods yielded improvements of ∼16\% and ∼6\% over the original unconstrained methods in kNN estimation of the TTC and MMSE on the ADNI database.},

  abstract = {We propose a framework of principal manifolds to model high-dimensional data. This framework is based on Sobolev spaces and designed to model data of any intrinsic dimension. It includes principal component analysis and principal curve algorithm as special cases. We propose a novel method for model complexity selection to avoid overfitting, eliminate the effects of outliers and improve the computation speed. Additionally, we propose a method for identifying the interiors of circle-like curves and cylinder/ball-like surfaces. The proposed approach is compared to existing methods by simulations and applied to estimate tumour surfaces and interiors in a lung cancer study.},

  abstract = {Many areas of science depend on exploratory data analysis and visualization. The need to analyze large amounts of multivariate data raises the fundamental problem of dimensionality reduction: how to discover compact representations of high-dimensional data. Here, we introduce locally linear embedding (LLE), an unsupervised learning algorithm that computes low-dimensional, neighborhood-preserving embeddings of high-dimensional inputs. Unlike clustering methods for local dimensionality reduction, LLE maps its inputs into a single global coordinate system of lower dimensionality, and its optimizations do not involve local minima. By exploiting the local symmetries of linear reconstructions, LLE is able to learn the global structure of nonlinear manifolds, such as those generated by images of faces or documents of text.}

  abstract = {For many complex diseases, there is a wide variety of ways in which an individual can manifest the disease. The challenge of personalized medicine is to develop tools that can accurately predict the trajectory of an individual's disease, which can in turn enable clinicians to optimize treatments. We represent an individual's disease trajectory as a continuous-valued continuous-time function describing the severity of the disease over time. We propose a hierarchical latent variable model that individualizes predictions of disease trajectories. This model shares statistical strength across observations at different resolutions--the population, subpopulation and the individual level. We describe an algorithm for learning population and subpopulation parameters offline, and an online procedure for dynamically learning individual-specific parameters. Finally, we validate our model on the task of predicting the course of interstitial lung disease, a leading cause of death among patients with the autoimmune disease scleroderma. We compare our approach against state-of-the-art and demonstrate significant improvements in predictive accuracy.},

  abstract = {Complex chronic diseases (e.g., autism, lupus, and Parkinson's) are remarkably heterogeneous across individuals. This heterogeneity makes treatment difficult for caregivers because they cannot accurately predict the way in which the disease will progress in order to guide treatment decisions. Therefore, tools that help to predict the trajectory of these complex chronic diseases can help to improve the quality of health care. To build such tools, we can leverage clinical markers that are collected at baseline when a patient first presents and longitudinally over time during follow-up visits. Because complex chronic diseases are typically systemic, the longitudinal markers often track disease progression in multiple organ systems. In this paper, our goal is to predict a function of time that models the future trajectory of a single target clinical marker tracking a disease process of interest. We want to make these predictions using the histories of many related clinical markers as input. Our proposed solution tackles several key challenges. First, we can easily handle irregularly and sparsely sampled markers, which are standard in clinical data. Second, the number of parameters and the computational complexity of learning our model grows linearly in the number of marker types included in the model. This makes our approach applicable to diseases where many different markers are recorded over time. Finally, our model accounts for latent factors influencing disease expression, whereas standard regression models rely on observed features alone to explain variability. Moreover, our approach can be applied dynamically in continous- time and updates its predictions as soon as any new data is available. We apply our approach to the problem of predicting lung disease trajectories in scleroderma, a complex autoimmune disease. We show that our model improves over state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy and we provide a qualitative analysis of our model's output. Finally, the variability of disease presentation in scleroderma makes clinical trial recruitment challenging. We show that a prognostic tool that integrates multiple types of routinely collected longitudinal data can be used to identify individuals at greatest risk of rapid progression and to target trial recruitment.},

  abstract = {Scientists working with large volumes of high-dimensional data, such as global climate patterns, stellar spectra, or human gene distributions, regularly confront the problem of dimensionality reduction: finding meaningful low-dimensional structures hidden in their high-dimensional observations. The human brain confronts the same problem in everyday perception, extracting from its high-dimensional sensory inputs—30,000 auditory nerve fibers or 106 optic nerve fibers—a manageably small number of perceptually relevant features. Here we describe an approach to solving dimensionality reduction problems that uses easily measured local metric information to learn the underlying global geometry of a data set. Unlike classical techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) and multidimensional scaling (MDS), our approach is capable of discovering the nonlinear degrees of freedom that underlie complex natural observations, such as human handwriting or images of a face under different viewing conditions. In contrast to previous algorithms for nonlinear dimensionality reduction, ours efficiently computes a globally optimal solution, and, for an important class of data manifolds, is guaranteed to converge asymptotically to the true structure.}

  abstract = {We propose a general family of nonparametric mixed effects models. Smoothing splines are used to model the fixed effects and are estimated by maximizing the penalized likelihood function. The random effects are generic and are modelled parametrically by assuming that the covariance function depends on a parsimonious set of parameters. These parameters and the smoothing parameter are estimated simultaneously by the generalized maximum likelihood method. We derive a connection between a nonparametric mixed effects model and a linear mixed effects model. This connection suggests a way of fitting a nonparametric mixed effects model by using existing programs. The classical two-way mixed models and growth curve models are used as examples to demonstrate how to use smoothing spline analysis-of-variance decompositions to build nonparametric mixed effects models. Similarly to the classical analysis of variance, components of these nonparametric mixed effects models can be interpreted as main effects and interactions. The penalized likelihood estimates of the fixed effects in a two-way mixed model are extensions of James–Stein shrinkage estimates to correlated observations. In an example three nested nonparametric mixed effects models are fitted to a longitudinal data set.},

  abstract = {In this article, we are concerned with data generated from a diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) experiment. The goal is to parameterize manifold-like white matter tracts, such as the corpus callosum, using principal surfaces. The problem is approached by finding a geometrically motivated surface-based representation of the corpus callosum and visualized fractional anisotropy (FA) values projected onto the surface. The method also applies to any other diffusion summary. An algorithm is proposed that (a) constructs the principal surface of a corpus callosum; (b) flattens the surface into a parametric two-dimensional (2D) map; and (c) projects associated FA values on the map. The algorithm is applied to a longitudinal study containing 466 diffusion tensor images of 176 multiple sclerosis (MS) patients observed at multiple visits. For each subject and visit, the study contains a registered DTI scan of the corpus callosum at roughly 20,000 voxels. Extensive simulation studies demonstrate fast convergence and robust performance of the algorithm under a variety of challenging scenarios.},
